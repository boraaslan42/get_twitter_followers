# get_twitter_followers
A 120 bucks freelance gig of mine is liberated \
Musk limited seeing others twitter followers to only 20 accounts from the frontend only lol
Its still technically and hopefully legally possible, to get ones followings
Beware, twitters api for getting user id from user handle is very fragile you may also use 3rd party sites to get id from handle
But follower retrieving api's headers are chill
Beware_2, get your headers and replace them on headers.json to run the code same applies for get_userid,
I was lazy so you have to change headers inside get_userid and you should know how to find proper headers urself.
If u fail to run this visit https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01419e1fc0370fdce8
